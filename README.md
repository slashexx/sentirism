# PRism: Open-Source AI-Driven Code Review Tool

**Say Goodbye to Tedious Code Reviews‚Äîand Hello to Flexible AI-Driven Reviews**

PRism is an open-source, self-hosted AI-powered tool designed to automate and enhance reviews of code, documentation, and more. It empowers teams to enforce standards, streamline workflows, and improve security without vendor lock-in or hidden costs. Whether running locally, on private servers, or in the cloud, PRism gives you the flexibility to choose any language model (LLM), including self-hosted ones via Ollama or open-source alternatives.

## **üåü Key Features**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Customizable Review Rules**
- Define your team's standards in a `RULES.md`, YAML, or JSON file.
- Use PRism to enforce:
  - **For code**: Naming conventions, logging consistency, and error handling practices.
  - **For documentation**: Grammar, formatting, and style guidelines.
  - **For security**: Framework-specific best practices and OWASP standards.
- Example: PRism flags snake_case variables in a camelCase project or suggests clearer documentation phrasing.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Static Analysis + AI-Powered Review**
- Combines traditional tools (like ESLint or GolangCI-Lint) with advanced AI reasoning to:
  - Analyze PRs based on `RULES.md`.
  - Highlight style, security, and architectural concerns.
  - Suggest improvements for both code and documentation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **LLM Recommendation System**
PRism includes a **built-in frontend** to guide users in selecting the best LLM for their use case:
- For **code reviews**: Opt for models like OpenAI Codex or Mistral.
- For **documentation reviews**: Use AI better suited for writing, such as GPT-4 or Claude.
- Recommendations include:
  - Open-source models for privacy-conscious users.
  - Cloud-hosted APIs for rapid setup.
  - **Cost estimates** for closed-source models, helping teams budget their usage.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Flexible Hosting Options**
- Run PRism locally, on private servers, or in the cloud:
  - **Self-hosted** LLMs via Ollama for maximum privacy and control.
  - **Cloud-based APIs** like OpenAI or Google Vertex AI for quick deployment.
- Fully customizable to balance performance, cost, and context-length needs.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **More Than Just Code**
PRism can review more than code‚Äîuse it to:
- Evaluate technical documentation for clarity and consistency.
- Assess markdown or YAML files for formatting and adherence to standards.
- Extend beyond development teams to writers, marketers, and DevOps workflows.

## **üí° How It Works**
1. **Input**: PRism reads your `RULES.md` and any files you've selected for review (code, documentation, or both).
2. **Analysis**:
   - Static analysis identifies common issues.
   - LLMs process nuanced requirements like tone, consistency, or security.
3. **Output**: Feedback is provided via:
   - PR comments in GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
   - CLI results for local review.
   - Detailed JSON, Markdown, or PDF reports.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

### **Step 1: Define Your Rules**
Create a `RULES.md` file with your team's standards:
- For code: Naming conventions, error handling, logging structure.
- For documentation: Grammar rules, formatting styles, or tone guidelines.

### **Step 2: Choose Your LLM**
Use PRism's frontend to get personalized recommendations for:
- The best LLM for your use case (code, documentation, or both).
- Cost estimates for closed-source APIs like OpenAI.
- Open-source alternatives for teams prioritizing privacy.

### **Step 3: Run PRism**
- Integrate PRism into your CI/CD pipeline for automated pre-merge checks.
- Use the CLI tool to review locally before pushing changes.
- Schedule periodic reviews to ensure codebase health.

## **ü§î Why PRism?**
PRism is designed for developers, writers, and teams who want:
- Full control over their workflows without vendor lock-in.
- Flexibility to adapt AI to diverse tasks like reviewing documentation or analyzing code.

- Leverage Codex or Mistral for code-related tasks.
- Customize prompts for each type of review for best results.
